#Global Architecture

## Typescript
I'm already familiar with Typescript with some advanced usage in the projects I'm currently involved in.
I had done small tutorials in react with JSX in the past few weeks, but for the work assignment I decided to give TSX a try.

## Forms & Validation
Since there is no default validation provided in react, I looked at different solutions, and I decided to use react-hook-form.
I struggled a bit for the custom error messages since the documentation is more for standard use cases, but I found some examples provided by users, in the end it does the job quite well.  

## Redux - react-redux
I'm used to ngrx (angular + redux + rxjs), and I was looking for a library, after going through several examples I decided to go for react-redux.
I also saw recoil but as far as I understood it's currently less mature than react-redux. The big difference with ngrx is that rxjs part is not included.
I found a library that combine redux pattern + rxjs for react but it seems less used.

## Testing - Jest
I'm currently used to jasmine/karma for unit tests, but I knew that Jest is currently one of the best front end testing framework, so I decided to use it. 

## Eslint/Prettier
I was already familiar with both, no need to explain the choice on this part I think, those are the reference in formatting and static code analysis
